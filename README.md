# Overview

**xyOps Satellite (xySat)** is a companion to the [xyOps](https://xyops.io) workflow automation and server monitoring platform.  It is both a job runner, and a data collector for server monitoring and alerting.  xySat is designed to be installed on *all* of your servers, so it is lean and mean, and has zero dependencies.
